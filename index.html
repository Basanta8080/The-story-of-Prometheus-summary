The early Civilization flourished in ancient Athens. The early Greek people had different stories concerning god, goddess, heroes and different kind of rituals. Those ancient stories still exists and the modern world interprets as the Greek myths. Promothes, one of the Titan gods, took the risk of stealing fire from heaven in order to give human beings on Earth. For this he suffered much in his life.
<br><br>
The king of Olympian gods, Zeus was trying to established his rule. There was a long and terrible war endured. All the Olympian gods joined against the Titans. Titans were led by Zeus father and atlas.
<br><br>
Prometheus in his brother Epimetheus, who where Titans, fought on the side of Zeus because he was very wise and foresaw the winner of the battle. After 10 years of fighting, Zeus and Olympian Gods defeated the enemy.
<br><br>
Once Zeus emerged victorious, he granted brothers some just rewards. Zeus permitted promothes and Epimetheus to populate the earth with creature and humans. Epimetheus foolishly gave all the good qualities to the creatures. He gave strength and speed, the ability to fly etc. When it came time for men to be given quality, there were few left. Epimetheus begged his brother for help. Promothes took over the task of creation and made way to make human superior.
<br><br>
When goddess of wisdom Athena was born out of the head of Zeus, she taught Prometheus different fields of knowledge and made smart.
<br><br>
Prometheus had created humans in likeness of God by using clay and water, and Athena had breathted a living soul into them. He passed onto man the useful art taught by Athena and looked with Joy up on his creation. When man sacrificed animals to the God, the Olympians God offered the best portion of animals, living little for the people. So Prometheus made trick choosing one pile of offering. He kept delicious portion to look, but inside kept fat in bone, Zeus chose fat and bone, and from then on humans got to keep good and tasty parts of the animal's offerings. This made Zeus mad and he took fire away from men.
<br><br>
Up on arriving he lit torch from the fiery chariot of the Sun god, breaking off a fragment of glowing charcoal, he hid the fire inside the hallow of a giant fennel stalk. Blowing out of his torch, in case he was not spotted by Zeus, promithes then worked his way down the side of Mount Olympus in brought fire to human.
<br><br>
Soon Zeus found smell of cooked and he loked downed he was furious. He sent three ferocious giant to arrest Prometheus and had taken him to the highest peak of mount Caucasus. on huge rock the Giants bound him unbreakable chain. Each day a huge eagle sent by Zeus. it ate promothes' liver, feasting on the helpless Titan. to make matter worse, the liver    would grow back overnight in the whole ordeal reopened the following day.
<br><br>
Prometheus could not die being a god. At one point Zeus offered him a chance to free himself by revealing his information of the power of foresight. Zeus wanted to know the name who would over throw him, just had Zeus had done to Cronus. But he refused it. Zeus felt bad because he could not bow promoters. Zeus told him that he could go free if two. condition were met:
<br>
1. An immortal would have to give up his life for Prometheus
<br>
2. A mortal would have to slay the liver eating eagle
<br><br>
The first condition was meet when Chiron, a Wise immortal mentor of many Greek heroes
Had been wounded by Hercules poisoned arrows. Chiron heard the plight of Prometheus and died voluntarily. second condition was met  when world's greatest hero Hercules Saw a frightful eagle eating promothes liver. he killed it with poisoned arrow.
<br><br>
Now Prometheus was free. Zeus realised his fault and foolishness. He invite promothes to Mount Olympus and to live there. He rejoined the place at home of the gods. He was given a ring, which a piece of Caucasus rock set, as a symbol of his painful connection with the mountain. Ever since humans have worn rings in honor of The Titan, in gratitude for all the agony he had endured on their behalf.
